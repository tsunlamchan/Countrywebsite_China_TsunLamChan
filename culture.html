    <h1>Chinese Culture</h1>
  </div>
  <p>
      Chinese culture is one of the oldest in the world. It is known for important
      traditions such as Chinese New Year, the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the Dragon
      Boat Festival. Families often celebrate with special foods, fireworks, and
      gatherings. Chinese culture also includes calligraphy, traditional clothing,
      martial arts, and respect for family. These customs have been passed down for
      thousands of years and still play a big part in daily life today.
